# Phonebook Fetcher Interval (in seconds)
# The interval at which the phonebook fetcher thread will attempt to download
# the CSV phonebook from the configured servers.
# Default: 3600 (1 hour)
PB_INTERVAL_SECONDS=3600

# Phonebook Servers
# Define the phonebook servers from which the CSV file will be downloaded.
# Each server should be on its own line using the format:
# PHONEBOOK_SERVER=host,port,path
# The application will try servers in the order they appear until a successful download.
# You can add up to MAX_PB_SERVERS (currently 5) entries.

# Status Update Interval (in seconds)
# The interval at which the status updater thread will check for phonebook changes
# and update the active/inactive status of registered users.
# Default: 600 (10 minutes)
STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600


# ============================================================================
# MONITORING SETTINGS (UAC Testing)
# ============================================================================

# UAC Test Interval (in seconds)
# The interval at which the UAC bulk test thread will test all reachable phones.
# Set to 0 to disable monitoring completely.
# Default: 60 (1 minute)
UAC_TEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600

# UAC Ping Test Settings (ICMP - Network Layer)
# Number of ICMP ping requests to send per phone for latency measurement.
# Tests network-layer connectivity and measures RTT/jitter at the IP level.
# Set to 0 to disable ICMP ping testing.
# Range: 0-20
# Default: 5
UAC_PING_COUNT=5

# UAC Options Test Settings (SIP OPTIONS - Application Layer)
# Number of SIP OPTIONS requests to send per phone for latency measurement.
# Tests application-layer connectivity and measures RTT/jitter at the SIP level.
# Each OPTIONS request measures round-trip time. Multiple requests allow jitter calculation.
# Set to 0 to disable OPTIONS testing.
# Range: 0-20
# Default: 5
UAC_OPTIONS_COUNT=5

# UAC Call Test (INVITE - rings phone briefly)
# Enable/disable the INVITE call test that actually rings phones.
# Only used as fallback if both ping and options tests fail.
# 0 = disabled, 1 = enabled
# Default: 0 (disabled - recommended to avoid disturbing users)
UAC_CALL_TEST_ENABLED=0

# UAC Test Phone Number Prefix (INVITE test only)
# Only perform INVITE tests on phone numbers starting with this prefix.
# Ping and OPTIONS tests will run for ALL phones regardless of prefix.
# This allows selective calling tests while monitoring all phones.
# Default: 4415
UAC_TEST_PREFIX=4415
